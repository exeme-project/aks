Anti-Keeb-Sploof prevents spoofed keyboard attacks by blocking new input devices such as keyboards and mice.

> **Note** AKS is currently in the alpha stages of development. Once the module reaches a stable release the relevant documentation will be created.

## Features

* Prevent unknown keyboards / mice from providing inputs before they can cause damage to the host.

## Installation

> **Note** AKS is planned to only support Windows. This is because I want to focus on Windows support first. After a stable release has been reached, cross-platform support will be re-looked at.

Coming Soon...
